## Content Rules (apply to every scrape, always)

These rules are enforced automatically by `enrichment.py`. They are documented
here so any future code changes maintain the same standards.

### 1. Listing — drop entire listing if branded by a competitor
If a listing's text metadata (agent name, broker name, description, showing
instructions, or the raw MLS data blob) contains a known competitor brand
(e.g. FirstKey Homes, Invitation Homes, Progress Residential, Coldwell Banker,
Keller Williams, RE/MAX, etc.) the **entire listing is dropped** and never
enters the pipeline. This is a text/metadata heuristic — not a per-photo
analysis — so it catches corporate-managed properties reliably before any
photos are fetched.
→ Enforced by `is_watermarked()` in `enrichment.py`.

### 2. Photo — remove branded individual photos, keep the rest
If a listing has mostly clean property photos but one or more photos show
company logos, agent headshots, office exteriors, or brokerage branding, those
**specific photos are removed** while the rest of the listing is kept.
→ Enforced by `filter_record_photos()` / `filter_branded_photos()` in `enrichment.py`.

### 3. Description — remove all "schedule a tour" / "contact for viewing" language
Any sentence asking the reader to schedule a showing, contact an agent, call,
email, or arrange a viewing must be stripped from the description. This includes
all variants: "Book a tour", "Contact us for more info", "Schedule a private
showing", "Call today", "Reach out to schedule", etc.
→ Enforced by `clean_description()` in `enrichment.py`.

### 4. Description — every listing must end with an "Apply Now" CTA
Every published description must end with an invitation to submit a rental
application through Choice Properties. The CTA is appended automatically if
one is not already present.
→ Enforced by `append_apply_cta()` in `enrichment.py`.

### 5. Photo — never publish properties where all photos carry initials/watermarks
Same as rule 1, restated for clarity: if every photo has an agent initial, a
brokerage watermark, or a competitor logo overlaid, skip the listing entirely.

### 6. Photo — minimum 6 photos required per listing
Any listing with fewer than 6 source photos is dropped during filter and
rejected by the pre-publish validation gate. Sparse galleries (1–5 photos)
look poor on the property detail page and reduce conversion.
→ Enforced in `filter_records()` and `validate()` in every batch script,
  and in `validate_for_publish()` in `enrichment.py`.

### 7. Photo quality — Realtor CDN images are upgraded to maximum resolution
When scraping from Realtor.com, photo URLs are upgraded to `w-2016,q-95`
(the CDN's maximum quality tier) rather than stripped to the bare URL.
This avoids the default CDN resolution (often 1024px) and ensures every
scraped photo arrives at 2016px wide / 95% quality before ImageKit
re-encodes it.
→ Enforced by `_upgrade_photo_url()` in `scraper.py`.
